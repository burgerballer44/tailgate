# PHP Style

- PSR-12 formatting; typed properties; strict types where possible.
- Don't do declare(strict_types=1);.
- Return types on all public methods; prefer readonly where applicable.
- Avoid static helpers; use pure functions or injected services.
- The docblock for all methods should include comments about why it would be used, not just what it does.
