# Tests

- Use **PestPHP** with clear, human-readable test names.
- Follow **Arrange/Act/Assert** pattern; avoid hidden globals.
- Include feature tests for user-facing functionality.
- Provide at least one negative test and one edge-case test for each feature.
- Use **factories** for test data setup.
- Include unit tests for business logic, services, and helper classes.
- Maintain high code coverage but focus on meaningful tests over 100% coverage obsession.
